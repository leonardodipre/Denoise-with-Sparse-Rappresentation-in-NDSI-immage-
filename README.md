# Sentinel_2_snow_index


Structure of the project

The project is divided into two main .ipynb files. 

    The first one, "De_noising.ipynb," outlines the logic where we load the initial image and apply various denoising filters. The code is housed in the "Algoritmi con dizionario e sparce solver" section.

    The other piece of code is located within "change_det," and the file "chang_dect.ipynb" loads the filtered images, finding the change detection between them and calculating accuracy.
